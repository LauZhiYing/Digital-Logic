# Reflection
In this course, I have learned a lot regarding logic circuits, digital electronics, programmable logic devices and many more. I also get to try hands on lab activities to connect circuit in physical. It was a really fun experience and has helped me to understand more regarding the knowledge that I learned.                                                                                                 
However, I think that it would be better if there could be more group activities  to enable us to share ideas together.
